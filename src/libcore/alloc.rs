/// # Definitions
///
/// * An allocation is "currently allocated by this allocator" if:
///
///   * The allocation pointer was obtained from a previous call to one of the
///   memory allocation methods returned by this allocator.
///
///   * An `Allocation` built using this pointer has not been previously
///   deallocated.
///
/// * An allocation's layout "fits the memory block of the allocation" if:
///
///   * The size and alignment of the allocation layout are in range of the
///   layout requested when performing the allocation, the layout returned
///   by the memory allocator, and the alignment is a power of two.
///
/// # Unsafety
///
/// Implementors of the `GlobalAlloc` trait must ensure that:
///
/// * Pointers of returned `Allocation`s point to valid memory and retain their
///   validity until they are passed to an allocation functions that invalidates
///   them (like deallocation or reallocation functions).
///
/// * None of the trait method implementations unwind the stack, that is, they
///   do not `panic!`.
///
/// # Unsafety
///
/// The `Alloc` trait is an `unsafe` trait for a number of reasons, and
/// implementors must ensure that they adhere to these contracts:
///
/// * Pointers returned from allocation functions must point to valid memory and
///   retain their validity until at least the instance of `Alloc` is dropped
///   itself.
///
/// # Error handling
///
/// All methods of the `Alloc` trait are infallible, that is, they are not
/// allowed to `abort` or `unwind` on error, but must return an `Err` instead.
///
/// Clients wishing to abort computation in response to an allocation
/// error are encouraged to call the allocator's `oom` method, rather than
/// directly invoking `panic!` or similar.
